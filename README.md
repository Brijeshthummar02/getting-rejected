Have you ever asked your friend for help, only to be met with a dry response? Well, I decided to channel that experience into a fun little project! This program, built in multiple programming languages, simulates that feeling by simply replying, "I'm sorry, I can't assist with it." It's a light-hearted reminder that sometimes, rejection is just part of life!
